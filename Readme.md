**Project Title:** Representation of Russia in British press before and after Annexation of Crimea
**Course:** Corpus Approaches to discourse analysis, Spring 2020, University of Siena (Italy)

**Abstract:** In 2014 the Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russian state from Ukraine. This event was considered a violation of many international laws and led to strict measures implemented against the country. The current study investigates representation of Russia in British press one year before and after annexation of Crimea. The analysis will expose first the increase of articles in press after the event and the tendency for representation of Russia to be consistently negative. The uniqueness of the project is that the corpus data were both collected and analyzed with the application of natural language processing tools and different parsing algorithms. This allows not only to get more precise results from the corpus but also to compare the accuracy of different techniques that can be implemented in a future development of software tools for corpus processing.
